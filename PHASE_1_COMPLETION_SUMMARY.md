# Phase 1: Flux Operator Installation & Configuration - COMPLETED

## Summary

Phase 1 has been successfully completed. All necessary research, planning, and configuration files have been created to migrate from manual Flux installation (v2.6.4) to Flux Operator (v0.32.0).

## Deliverables

### 1. Research & Analysis Documents
- ✅ **FLUX_OPERATOR_MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md** - Comprehensive research on Flux Operator architecture
- ✅ **FLUX_OPERATOR_CLUSTER_STATE.md** - Current cluster state analysis with kubectl inspection
- ✅ **FLUX_OPERATOR_MIGRATION_PLAN.md** - Detailed migration strategy and rollback plan
- ✅ **FLUX_OPERATOR_MIGRATION_EXECUTION.md** - Step-by-step execution guide

### 2. Configuration Files Created

#### Flux Operator
- ✅ `kubernetes/apps/flux-system/flux-operator/app/helmrelease.yaml`
- ✅ `kubernetes/apps/flux-system/flux-operator/app/ocirepository.yaml`
- ✅ `kubernetes/apps/flux-system/flux-operator/app/kustomization.yaml`
- ✅ `kubernetes/apps/flux-system/flux-operator/ks.yaml`

#### FluxInstance
- ✅ `kubernetes/apps/flux-system/flux-instance/app/helmrelease.yaml`
- ✅ `kubernetes/apps/flux-system/flux-instance/app/ocirepository.yaml`
- ✅ `kubernetes/apps/flux-system/flux-instance/app/kustomization.yaml`
- ✅ `kubernetes/apps/flux-system/flux-instance/ks.yaml`

#### Cluster Sync Configuration
- ✅ `kubernetes/flux/cluster/ks.yaml` - Main Kustomization for cluster apps

### 3. Updated Files
- ✅ `kubernetes/apps/flux-system/kustomization.yaml` - Added flux-operator and flux-instance
- ✅ `bootstrap/helmfile.d/01-apps.yaml` - Updated Flux Operator and FluxInstance to v0.32.0

### 4. Documentation
- ✅ **BOOTSTRAP_PROCESS_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Complete bootstrap process guide

## Key Findings from Cluster Inspection

### Current State
- **Flux Version**: v2.7.2 (CLI) / v2.6.4 (distribution)
- **Status**: All components healthy and reconciling
- **Kustomizations**: 80+ active Kustomizations
- **HelmReleases**: 52 HelmRelease files across apps
- **Secrets**: All required secrets present (github-deploy-key, sops-age)
- **ConfigMaps**: All required ConfigMaps present (cluster-settings, cluster-secrets)

### Cluster Health
- ✅ All Flux controllers running
- ✅ All GitRepositories syncing
- ✅ All Kustomizations reconciling
- ✅ SOPS decryption working
- ✅ Variable substitution working

## Configuration Preserved

All current Flux patches have been migrated to FluxInstance:
1. ✅ NetworkPolicy removal
2. ✅ Concurrent workers (--concurrent=8)
3. ✅ API QPS/burst limits (500/1000)
4. ✅ Memory limits (2Gi)
5. ✅ Helm OOM detection
6. ✅ Requeue dependency (5s)

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Manual Flux)
```
bootstrap/flux/kustomization.yaml
  ↓
kubernetes/flux/config/flux.yaml (OCIRepository + Kustomization)
  ↓
Flux components (source, helm, kustomize, notification controllers)
  ↓
kubernetes/flux/config/cluster.yaml (GitRepository + Kustomization)
  ↓
kubernetes/apps (all applications)
```

### After (Flux Operator)
```
bootstrap/helmfile.d/01-apps.yaml
  ↓
Flux Operator HelmRelease
  ↓
FluxInstance HelmRelease
  ↓
Flux Operator manages Flux components
  ↓
FluxInstance syncs from kubernetes/flux/cluster/ks.yaml
  ↓
kubernetes/apps (all applications)
```

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETED
- Research and planning
- Configuration file creation
- Documentation

### Phase 2: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
- Deploy Flux Operator via Helmfile
- Deploy FluxInstance via Helmfile
- Verify both are running

### Phase 3: VERIFICATION
- Confirm Flux Operator pod running
- Confirm FluxInstance reconciling
- Confirm all Flux controllers running
- Confirm HelmReleases reconciling

### Phase 4: CLEANUP
- Remove old kubernetes/flux/config/flux.yaml
- Remove old bootstrap kustomization
- Update documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Review Configuration Files**
   - Verify all created files are correct
   - Check FluxInstance patches match current configuration

2. **Test in Staging (Recommended)**
   - Deploy to staging cluster first
   - Verify all components work correctly
   - Monitor for any issues

3. **Deploy to Production**
   - Run helmfile to install Flux Operator
   - Run helmfile to install FluxInstance
   - Monitor logs and events

4. **Verify Migration**
   - Check all Flux controllers are running
   - Check all HelmReleases are reconciling
   - Check no duplicate Flux components

5. **Cleanup**
   - Remove old Flux configuration
   - Update bootstrap documentation
   - Commit changes to repository

## Important Notes

1. **No Breaking Changes**: Old Flux can run alongside new Flux during transition
2. **All Secrets Present**: github-deploy-key and sops-age already exist
3. **Patches Preserved**: All current patches migrated to FluxInstance
4. **GitRepository Unchanged**: Same URL and configuration
5. **Easy Rollback**: Can revert to old Flux if issues occur

## Files to Review

Before proceeding to Phase 2, review:
1. `kubernetes/apps/flux-system/flux-instance/app/helmrelease.yaml` - Verify patches
2. `kubernetes/flux/cluster/ks.yaml` - Verify cluster sync configuration
3. `bootstrap/helmfile.d/01-apps.yaml` - Verify versions and dependencies

## Success Criteria for Phase 2

- [ ] Flux Operator pod is running and healthy
- [ ] FluxInstance is created and reconciling
- [ ] All Flux controllers are running (source, helm, kustomize, notification)
- [ ] GitRepository is syncing
- [ ] All HelmReleases are reconciling
- [ ] No errors in Flux logs
- [ ] Cluster stability maintained
